Solution :

with cte as (
    select product_id , 
     rank() over(partition by product_id order by change_date desc) as rankdate,
     change_date , new_price
     from Products
     where change_date <='2019-08-16'
)

select product_id , new_price as price
from cte 
where rankdate =1 
union 
select product_id , 10 as price
from Products where product_id not in (select product_id from cte)
